# OSINTBuddy: *Transformative Link Analysis*

~ *Making advanced OSINT techniques accessible to everyone-from solo researchers to large organizations. [For free.](https://www.fsf.org/appeal)* ~


OSINTBuddy transforms scattered data points into actionable intelligence networks through visual discovery and an extensible plugin system. We're building an open-source alternative to proprietary OSINT tools, such as Maltego, that enables researchers to map relationships, identify patterns, and uncover insights that traditional methods can miss.

## Project Status

> [!CAUTION] 
>
> **⚠️ Experimental Software** (Alpha)
>
> OSINTBuddy is currently experimental software. We're not quite ready for action. We can't yet recommend using the project for anything serious. ⚠️ 


## What's OSINTBuddy?

- **Visual Intelligence Made Simple**: Intuitive graph-based interface transforms complex data relationships into clear, interactive visualizations.
- **Extensible Plugin Architecture**: Python-based plugin system allows custom entities to pull from any data source.
- **Self-hosted**: Your data stays under your control with full privacy and security
- **Cost-Effective**: Ditch the enterprise pricing, access advanced OSINT capabilities with free and open source software.

## Quick Start
 
*We're not quite ready for action yet but if you're interested in contributing to development please reach out to me by email at oss@osintbuddy.com*
