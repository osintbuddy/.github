# OSINTBuddy: Transformative Link Analysis

~ *Making advanced OSINT techniques accessible to everyone-from solo researchers to large organizations at affordable prices.* ~


OSINTBuddy is a professional intelligence analysis platform for investigators, researchers, and security teams who need **traceable, offline-first, graph-native workflows**. OSINTBuddy transforms scattered data points into actionable intelligence networks through visual discovery and an extensible open source plugin system. We're building an alternative to tools such as Maltego, that enables researchers and investigators to transform fragmented digital evidence into structured intelligence: entities, relationships, provenance, and hypotheses, all captured in a single analytical environment.

## Project Status

> [!CAUTION] 
>
> **⚠️ Closed Beta ⚠️**
> >
> OSINTBuddy is under active development.  
> Interfaces, data models, and APIs may change rapidly.
>
> Early access is limited and intentionally gated.


## What's OSINTBuddy?

- **Graph-Native by Design**: Intuitive graph-based interfaces transform complex data relationships into clear, interactive visualizations. Entities, relationships, evidence, and hypotheses are first-class primitives.
- **Extendable Intelligence Engine**: An open-source Python-based plugin system allows custom entities to pull from any data source.
- **Offline-First, Local Control:**  Your data can stay under your control with full privacy. Investigations live on your machine. No mandatory cloud sync. No silent telemetry.
- **Cost-Effective**: Ditch the enterprise pricing, pay for updates, own for life. We're enabling individuals and organization with access to advanced OSINT capabilities. 

## Access & Availability

The desktop OSINTBuddy application is **closed-source, proprietary software**. 

Access is currently limited to:
- Internal development
- Selected early partners
- Research collaborators

There is no public download at this time.

For access inquiries:
**jerlendds@osintbuddy.com**

In addition we also have an old open-source but uncompleted web/server version available at https://github.com/osintbuddy/web (**AGPL**) for those who are interested.
